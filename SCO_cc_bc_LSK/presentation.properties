# This file (presentation.properties) is an optional file that enables SCORM courses to interact
# with the DigitalThink learning environment when deployed on the DigitalThink L5 delivery platform.
# It is automatically generated by L5 SCORM Producer each time a course is created. 
# The presentation.properties file is available if needed and is otherwise ignored by all other 
# SCORM platforms.
